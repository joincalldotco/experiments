# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The screen sharing feature will allow users to share their screen content with other participants in a video call room. This feature will enable real-time collaboration, presentations, and demonstrations within the existing WebRTC-based video conferencing application. The implementation will leverage the existing mediasoup infrastructure to handle the screen sharing media streams.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a call participant, I want to share my screen with other participants in the room, so that I can present content or collaborate on visual information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user selects a screen/window to share THEN the system SHALL capture that content as a video stream
3. WHEN screen sharing starts THEN the system SHALL notify all other participants in the room
4. WHEN screen sharing is active THEN the system SHALL display the shared screen to all participants in the room
5. WHEN a user clicks "Stop Sharing" THEN the system SHALL stop the screen share for all participants

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a call participant, I want to view another participant's shared screen, so that I can see their presented content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN another participant starts screen sharing THEN the system SHALL display their shared screen to me
2. WHEN multiple participants share screens simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle multiple screen shares appropriately
3. WHEN viewing a shared screen THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable video quality and frame rate
4. WHEN a screen share ends THEN the system SHALL notify me and return to the normal call view

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a call participant, I want the screen sharing feature to be reliable and performant, so that my presentations are smooth and effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sharing a screen THEN the system SHALL maintain a minimum frame rate of 15 fps under normal network conditions
2. WHEN network conditions degrade THEN the system SHALL adapt the screen sharing quality appropriately
3. WHEN sharing a screen THEN the system SHALL not significantly impact the audio/video quality of the regular call
4. WHEN sharing a screen THEN the system SHALL handle resolution changes if the user resizes the shared window

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a call participant, I want clear visual indicators of who is sharing their screen, so that I can easily identify the source of shared content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a participant is sharing their screen THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator showing who is sharing
2. WHEN I am sharing my screen THEN the system SHALL provide me with a clear indicator that my screen is being shared
3. WHEN multiple screens are being shared THEN the system SHALL provide a way to switch between different shared screens
